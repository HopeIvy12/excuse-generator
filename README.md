# **Excuse Generator App**  
An app designed to help you find the perfect excuse to get out of anything, built in 24 hours using React and PostgreSQL.

## **Description**  
Yesterday, we were given the brief to create anything we wanted in 24 hours. After some brainstorming using the **Disney Ideation Method**, our team decided to create something we all needâ€¦ an app to help you find the perfect excuse to get out of anything!

We built everything from front-end to back-end, including a database, and focused on sharpening our **React** skills in the process.

## **How It Works**  
- **Select a category**: Choose from a variety of excuses based on the situation you're trying to escape.
- **Get your excuse**: The app provides you with the best excuse for the category you chose.
  
It's that simple! Now, you're all set to get out of anything with style. ðŸ˜Ž

## **Tech Stack**  
- **React**: For building the front-end.  
- **PostgreSQL**: For managing and storing excuses in a database.  
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for the app.  
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the app.  
- **Playwright**: For automated testing.
